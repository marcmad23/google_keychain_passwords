# google_keychain_passwords
I collected some passwords from Google's Keychain Manager. Approximately 409 passwords, 204 containing only uppercase, lower case letters, and digits while the other 205 also include special characters.  
Each password has a value for the frequency of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters with a decimal value representing each.  
The starting character for each record has been recorded as well as the type of start each record possesses: special, uppercase, lowercase, number

This dataset could be used for visualizations or analytics comparing the passwords with special characters to those with none or passwords with diffenrent start types compared to eachother.
